# Kepler

Kepler is an in-progress implementation of the Mimblewimble protocol. Many characteristics are still undefined but the following constitutes a first set of choices:

  * Clean and minimal implementation, and aiming to stay as such.
  * Follows the Mimblewimble protocol, which provides hidden amounts and scaling advantages.
  * Cuckoo Cycle proof of work in two variants named Cuckaroo (ASIC-resistant) and Cuckatoo (ASIC-targeted).
  * Relatively fast block time: one minute.
  * Fixed block reward over time with a decreasing dilution.
  * Transaction fees are based on the number of Outputs created/destroyed and total transaction size.
  * Smooth curve for difficulty adjustments.

## Getting Started

To learn more about the technology, read our introduction.

To build and try out Kepler, see https://github.com/keplernetwork/kepler/wiki/How-to-Build-Kepler

## Philosophy

Kepler believes in keeping it simple. Users will feel welcomed by Kepler's cool appeal. Kepler will redefine how apps using the MW protocol are seen, ease of use comes to mind.

We believe in pull requests, data and scientific research. We do not believe in unfounded beliefs.
